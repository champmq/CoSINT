# CoSINT

AI-assisted OSINT Investigator (beta release).

Verify hypotheses about an entity, run a full profile scan or find a correlation between two entites and more.
Supports scans and pivots on email, domain, media, IP, username, phone, person and wallet.

> **Note:** This is a personal hobby project, it's a bit rough around the edges (there is a lot that can be improved). If you notice anything
> flawed or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a PR!

**Docs & guides:** [Wiki](https://github.com/champmq/cosint/wiki)

## Quick Start

Requires: Python 3.11 or newer

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure API keys and model via the setup wizard, install playwright browsers...
python setup.py # optional --skip-keys flag to skip API key setup

# 4. Run a scan
python cosint.py example.com
python cosint.py @username --depth deep --scope-mode guided
```

See [Example](https://github.com/champmq/CoSINT/tree/main/example) for a sample report and case file.

The setup wizard walks you through setting your AI provider credentials, adding API keys (with free-tier labels),
and installing optional packages. You can re-run it at any time without overwriting existing values.

If you prefer to configure manually, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the keys you need. Missing keys only
disable the specific tools that require them, everything else keeps working.

## Model setup

CoSINT uses [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) and supports any provider it supports. Set your model
and credentials in `.env`:

```bash
OSINT_MODEL=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...

# Other supported providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
AZURE_API_KEY=...
```

python cosint.py <target> [options]

Reports are written to `reports/` as a Markdown file and a `.case.json` after each scan.

## MCP server

CoSINT can also run as a standalone MCP server, exposing all 50+ tools directly to any MCP-compatible client such as
Claude Desktop without running a full CLI scan:

```bash
python server.py
```

See [`wiki/MCP-Server.md`](./wiki/MCP-Server.md) for client integration instructions.

## Testing

```bash
# Smoke test — confirms all tool modules load correctly
python -m unittest tests.test_smoke_all_modules -v

# Full test suite
python -m pytest -q
```
